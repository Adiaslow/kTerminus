## Executive Summary

k-Terminus is a distributed terminal session manager designed to orchestrate command-line environments across heterogeneous infrastructure through reverse SSH tunnels. Built in Rust with Tauri for cross-platform desktop deployment, k-Terminus enables unified management of multiple remote machines from a single local orchestrator.

### Implementation Status (February 2026)

- **Reverse tunnel architecture**: Client-initiated, firewall-friendly connections
- **Session multiplexing**: Multiple sessions over single tunnel per machine
- **Persistent connections**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Unified CLI**: Single binary for orchestrator, agent, and management
- **Cross-platform desktop GUI**: Tauri app with embedded terminal emulator
- **Layered security**: Tailscale WireGuard encryption + SSH transport

---

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Name Etymology

The name k-Terminus combines mathematical notation with classical terminology:

- **k-mer**: Computational biology term for sequence k-tuples, referencing the project's origin in research computing
- **k-nearest neighbors**: Machine learning algorithm representing graph-based computation, metaphorically analogous to distributed node management
- **Terminus**: Latin for "boundary" or "endpoint," the etymological root of "terminal." Also the Roman god of boundaries and landmarks

The hyphenated k- prefix evokes mathematical notation (k-space, k-means, k-fold) while grounding the tool in terminal management through the terminus component. This creates a professional, technical aesthetic appropriate for infrastructure tooling.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

#### Current Pain Points

- Claude Code sessions are isolated per-machine with no orchestration layer
- Multi-machine workflows require manual SSH connections and frequent context switching
- Firewalls and NAT complicate direct inbound connections to lab/research infrastructure
- No unified view of distributed terminal sessions across heterogeneous environment
- Nested SSH sessions create latency and complexity (SSH over SSH)

#### Target Environment

- Local development machine (MacBook, Linux workstation)
- University lab servers (behind institutional firewall)
- GPU compute nodes (restricted access, specialized hardware)
- CI/CD build machines (ephemeral, automated deployment)
- Research infrastructure (specialized software stacks, shared resources)

### 1.3 Solution Approach

k-Terminus implements a hub-and-spoke architecture where remote machines initiate reverse SSH tunnels to a local orchestrator. This inverts the traditional SSH model:

- **Firewall-friendly**: Remote machines connect outbound (typically allowed by default)
- **Persistent connections**: Tunnels remain open, enabling immediate session creation
- **Session multiplexing**: Multiple logical sessions over single tunnel (avoiding nested SSH)
- **Local orchestration**: All control logic runs on trusted local machine
- **Zero remote configuration**: Lightweight client agent is only remote component

---

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Design

The system consists of three primary components:

1. **Orchestrator** (local machine): Accepts reverse tunnels, manages connection pool, multiplexes sessions
2. **Client Agent** (remote machines): Lightweight daemon that establishes tunnel and manages local PTY sessions
3. **CLI/GUI Interface**: User-facing tools for session management and orchestration

### 2.2 Component Architecture

| Component | Responsibilities |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Orchestrator** | • Accept and authenticate reverse SSH tunnels<br>• Maintain connection pool with health monitoring<br>• Multiplex terminal sessions over tunnels<br>• Handle automatic reconnection with backoff<br>• Provide CLI/GUI interface to connected machines<br>• Persist connection state and configuration |
| **Client Agent** | • Establish outbound reverse SSH tunnel<br>• Authenticate using configured credentials<br>• Create and manage local PTY sessions<br>• Stream stdin/stdout/stderr bidirectionally<br>• Report system metrics (CPU, memory, disk)<br>• Handle window resize events |
| **CLI Interface** | • List connected machines and active sessions<br>• Create new sessions on specified machines<br>• Attach to existing sessions<br>• Execute one-off commands<br>• Query connection status and health<br>• Manage configuration |
| **GUI Interface** | • Visual topology of connected machines<br>• Interactive session management<br>• Real-time health and metrics dashboard<br>• Configuration editor<br>• Embedded terminal emulator<br>• Connection logs and diagnostics |

### 2.3 Data Flow

#### Connection Establishment

1. Remote client agent initiates outbound SSH connection to orchestrator
2. Orchestrator validates peer via Tailscale network membership (or accepts loopback)
3. Tunnel registered in connection pool with unique machine_id
4. Client sends initial capability/status message
5. Orchestrator confirms registration and begins heartbeat monitoring

#### Session Creation

1. User issues connect command via CLI
2. Orchestrator looks up machine_id in connection pool
3. Creates session request with unique session_id
4. Sends request over tunnel to client agent
5. Client allocates PTY and spawns shell process
6. Bidirectional stream established (stdin → PTY → stdout)
7. User terminal attached to remote session

#### Session Interaction

- Local keystrokes → Orchestrator → Tunnel → Client Agent → PTY stdin
- PTY stdout → Client Agent → Tunnel → Orchestrator → Local terminal
- Window resize → Orchestrator → Tunnel → Client Agent → PTY ioctl

## 3. Technical Stack

### 3.1 Core Technologies

| Technology | Purpose | Rationale |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| **Rust** | Core language for all components | Memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, excellent async support, cross-platform single binary |
| **Tokio** | Async runtime | Production-grade async I/O for handling concurrent connections efficiently |
| **Tauri** | Desktop application framework | Lightweight Rust-based alternative to Electron with native OS integration |
| **russh** | SSH protocol implementation | Pure Rust SSH library with async support for tunnel management |
| **portable-pty** | Cross-platform PTY | Unified PTY abstraction for Unix and Windows terminal emulation |
| **clap** | CLI argument parsing | Robust command-line interface with subcommands and validation |
| **serde + TOML** | Configuration serialization | Human-readable configuration format with type-safe deserialization |
| **Tailscale** | Mesh VPN networking | Zero-config networking across NAT/firewalls, stable device identities, WireGuard encryption, implicit trust boundary |

### 3.2 Design Rationale: Why Rust?

- **Embedded Ecosystem**: Tauri and portable-pty provide first-class Rust support for desktop GUI and terminal emulation

---

## 4. Protocol Design

### 4.1 Reverse Tunnel Protocol

#### Connection Lifecycle

1. **Client Initiation**: Remote agent initiates outbound SSH connection to orchestrator's listening port
2. **Authentication**: Tailscale peer verification (or loopback acceptance for local connections)
3. **Registration**: Client sends capability message containing machine_id, hostname, system info
4. **Confirmation**: Orchestrator acknowledges registration and begins heartbeat protocol
5. **Steady State**: Tunnel remains open with periodic heartbeats (30s interval)
6. **Failure Handling**: Connection loss triggers automatic reconnection with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, max 60s)

### 4.2 Session Multiplexing Protocol

Multiple terminal sessions are multiplexed over a single SSH tunnel using a lightweight framing protocol.

#### Message Format

- **Header**: 8 bytes (session_id: 4 bytes, message_type: 1 byte, payload_length: 3 bytes)
- **Payload**: Variable-length binary data

#### Message Types

| Type | Code | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **SessionCreate** | 0x01 | Request new PTY allocation |
| **SessionReady** | 0x02 | Acknowledge session creation with PTY details |
| **Data** | 0x03 | Stdin/stdout/stderr streams |
| **Resize** | 0x04 | Window dimension changes (rows, cols) |
| **SessionClose** | 0x05 | Terminate session |
| **Heartbeat** | 0x06 | Keep-alive ping |
| **HeartbeatAck** | 0x07 | Keep-alive pong |
| **Register** | 0x08 | Agent registration with machine info |
| **RegisterAck** | 0x09 | Registration acknowledgment |
| **Error** | 0xFF | Error response |

### 4.3 Authentication & Security

#### Authentication Mechanism

- Tailscale network membership is the primary authentication
- Loopback connections (127.0.0.1) are always accepted for local development
- Public key authentication over SSH (no passwords)
- Each machine identified by Tailscale device name

#### Security Considerations

- SSH provides transport encryption (all data encrypted in transit)
- WireGuard (Tailscale) provides additional encryption layer
- Host key verification prevents MITM attacks
- Orchestrator only accepts connections from same Tailscale network
- No credential storage on remote machines (key-based auth only)
- Session isolation: Each session runs in separate PTY with distinct process context

### 4.4 Network Layer (Tailscale Integration)

k-Terminus uses Tailscale as its network layer to provide seamless connectivity across any network topology.

#### Why Tailscale?

- **NAT Traversal**: Works through firewalls, corporate NAT, hotel WiFi, mobile hotspots
- **Stable Identities**: Each device gets a persistent hostname (e.g., `laptop.tailnet.ts.net`) that never changes
- **Zero Configuration**: No port forwarding, no dynamic DNS, no manual IP management
- **WireGuard Security**: Military-grade encryption with minimal overhead
- **Free Tier**: 100 devices, sufficient for personal/small team use

#### Network Architecture

```

│   └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Device Discovery

Machines are addressed by Tailscale hostname rather than IP:
- Orchestrator: `my-laptop.tailnet-abc.ts.net:2222`
- Connect: `k-terminus join my-laptop` (resolves automatically)

#### Dependency

Tailscale must be installed and authenticated on all machines. The `k-terminus setup` command handles detection, installation, and configuration automatically.

### 4.5 Tailscale-Based Authentication

k-Terminus uses Tailscale as its authentication layer. Being on the same Tailscale network is the trust boundary - no additional OAuth or manual key exchange required.

#### Why Tailscale for Auth?

- **No Manual Key Exchange**: Users don't need to copy SSH keys between machines
- **Already Authenticated**: You logged into Tailscale via SSO (Google, GitHub, Microsoft, etc.)
- **Implicit Trust**: Same tailnet = same user/organization = trusted
- **Simple Revocation**: Remove device from Tailscale to revoke access

#### Connection Flow

```
Agent (Remote)                              Orchestrator (Local)
     │                                              │

     │                         "Is 100.x.x.y in my tailnet?"
     │                                              │
     │                         Yes: "lab-server.tailnet.ts.net"
     │                                              │
     ├─── SSH handshake ───────────────────────────▶│

     └─── Register: {device: "lab-server"} ────────▶│
```

#### Security Model

| Layer | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Identity | Tailscale device identity (verified via SSO) |
| Authorization | Same tailnet = trusted |
| Network | Tailscale WireGuard (encrypted) |
| Transport | SSH (encrypted tunnel) |

All traffic is encrypted twice (WireGuard + SSH). Tailscale handles identity verification.

## 6. Command-Line Interface

### 6.1 Core Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `k-terminus serve` | Start orchestrator and begin accepting connections |
| `k-terminus join <host>` | Connect to orchestrator as an agent (host = Tailscale hostname) |
| `k-terminus list` | Display all connected machines and active sessions with status |
| `k-terminus connect <machine>` | Create new session on specified machine and attach terminal |
| `k-terminus status` | Show orchestrator status and connection health metrics |
| `k-terminus stop` | Stop orchestrator daemon |
| `k-terminus kill <session>` | Terminate specified session |
| `k-terminus config show` | Display current configuration |
| `k-terminus config edit` | Open config file in editor |
| `k-terminus config path` | Print config directory path |

### 6.2 Command Examples

#### Basic Workflow

```bash
# On your main machine - start the orchestrator
$ k-terminus serve
Starting k-Terminus orchestrator...
Listening on my-laptop.tailnet-abc.ts.net:2222

To connect agents, run on remote machines:
  k-terminus join my-laptop

# On a remote machine - join the orchestrator
$ k-terminus join my-laptop
Connecting to my-laptop.tailnet-abc.ts.net...
Connected! This machine is now available as "lab-server"

# Back on your main machine - list connected machines
$ k-terminus list
MACHINE          STATUS     SESSIONS  UPTIME
lab-gpu-01       connected  1         2d 7h
home-server      connected  0         12h 45m

# Connect to remote session
$ k-terminus connect lab-gpu-01
[lab-gpu-01:session-3] $
```

Both machines must be on the same Tailscale network. That's it - no OAuth setup, no manual key copying.

#### Advanced Usage (Planned)

```bash
# List sessions with filtering
$ k-terminus list --machine lab-gpu-01
$ k-terminus list --tag gpu

# View connection health
$ k-terminus status
Orchestrator: running (pid 12345)
Connections: 3 active
Sessions: 3 active
Uptime: 2d 5h 12m

# Kill a session
$ k-terminus kill lab-gpu-01:session-3
Session terminated
```

## 10. Conclusion

k-Terminus addresses a critical gap in distributed development workflows by providing unified orchestration of terminal sessions across heterogeneous infrastructure. The reverse tunnel architecture solves real-world networking constraints while the multiplexing protocol ensures efficient resource utilization.

Built in Rust with Tauri, k-Terminus delivers native performance with memory safety guarantees. The modular architecture enables future extensibility while maintaining a clean separation of concerns between orchestration, transport, and presentation layers.

While primarily designed for managing Claude Code sessions across research infrastructure, k-Terminus is architected as a general-purpose tool suitable for any distributed terminal workflow. The combination of firewall-friendly reverse tunnels, persistent connections, and unified management makes it valuable for remote development, CI/CD orchestration, and multi-datacenter operations.

The name k-Terminus embodies the project's mathematical rigor (k-space, k-nearest neighbors) and classical foundations (Latin terminus), positioning it as professional infrastructure tooling for the modern era.

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Package Availability

Comprehensive verification confirms k-Terminus name availability across all major package managers:

- **crates.io (Rust)**: Available
- **npm**: Available
- **Homebrew**: Available
- **GitHub organization**: Available

Recommended distribution strategy:

- Primary: `cargo install k-terminus`
- macOS: `brew install k-terminus`
- Linux: Download binary from GitHub releases
- Desktop: Tauri app bundle (.dmg, .deb, .exe)

#### Complete Installation Flow

```bash
# On your main machine (orchestrator)
cargo install k-terminus
k-terminus serve          # Start accepting connections

# On remote machines (agents)
k-terminus join <your-device-name>   # Connect to orchestrator
```

Both machines must be on the same Tailscale network.

**Prerequisites:**
- Rust toolchain (`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`)
- Tailscale account (free at tailscale.com) - same account on all machines

### Appendix B: Alternative Names Considered

During naming research, numerous alternatives were evaluated and rejected due to namespace collisions or semantic mismatch. Notable rejections include:

- **Swarm**: Saturated (Docker Swarm, Zellij workspace, multiple agent frameworks)
- **Fleet**: Saturated (Kolide Fleet, serverless platforms)
- **HyperTerm**: Major collision with Vercel's popular terminal emulator
- **Terminus**: Saturated (Pantheon CLI, multiple emulators, Warp docs)
- **Span**: Taken (SPAN.io smart panel CLI)
- **Atlas**: Heavily saturated (MongoDB, O'Reilly, Intel, note-taking)
- **Fiber**: Taken (Go framework, Uber distributed computing)

The k- prefix successfully differentiates from these existing tools while maintaining the mathematical and terminal management semantics core to the project identity.
