## Documentation Philosophy

Our documentation follows these principles:

1. **User-first**: Start with what users need, not what the code does
2. **Task-oriented**: Organize by what you want to accomplish
3. **Example-driven**: Show, don't just tell
4. **Honest**: Document limitations and trade-offs
5. **Current**: Keep in sync with code changes
